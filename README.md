zsh-grml-funcs
==============

Functions taken from the grml distribution

Install
-------

For the lazy:

    git clone https://github.com/willghatch/zsh-grml-funcs
    echo "source zsh-snippets/zsh-grml-funcs.plugin.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc

Better, use [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) or [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs).  Here is how to do it with antigen:

    antigen bundle willghatch/zsh-grml-funcs

What is this?
-------------

Grml is a distribution that includes a cool .zshrc.  But it's not modular!  So I took a bunch of their stuff and put it in here.  It is not comprehensive, but includes a lot of grml's stuff.  I've changed and improved on various things.  Mostly this repository is a mess of me rummaging through grml's .zshrc and grabbing what I want.

Maybe I'll document it better later... but at any rate, it's got some useful functions.
